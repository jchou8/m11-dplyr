# Exercise 4: DPLYR and flights data

# Install the nycflights13 package and read it in.  Require the dplyr package
# install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# The data.frame flights should now be accessible to you.  View it, 
# and get some basic information about the number of rows/columns
View(flights)
nrow(flights)
ncol(flights)

# Add a column that is the amount of time gained in the air (`arr_delay` - `dep_delay`)
flights <- mutate(flights, air_gain = arr_delay - dep_delay)

# Sort your data.frame desceding by the column you just created
flights <- arrange(flights, desc(air_gain))

# Try doing the last 2 steps in a single operation using the pipe operator
flights <- mutate(flights, air_gain = arr_delay - dep_delay) %>% arrange(desc(air_gain))

# Make a histogram of the amount of gain using the `hist` command
hist(flights$air_gain)

# On average, did flights gain or lose time?
average.gain <- mean(flights$air_gain, na.rm = TRUE)

# Create a data.frame that is of flights headed to seatac ('SEA'), 
sea.flights <- filter(flights, dest == "SEA")

# On average, did flights to seatac gain or loose time?
sea.average <- mean(sea.flights$air_gain, na.rm = TRUE)

### Bonus ###
# Write a function that allows you to specify an origin, a destination, and a column of interest
# that returns a data.frame of flights from the origin to the destination and only the column of interest
## Hint: see chapter 11 section on standard evaluation
FlightFilter <- function(my.origin, my.dest, column) {
  return (filter(flights, my.origin == origin, my.dest == dest) %>% select_(column))
}

# Retireve the air_time column for flights from JFK to SEA
jfk.sea.airtime <- FlightFilter("JFK", "SEA", "air_time")

# What was the min/max/average air time for the JFK to SEA flights (in hours)?
jfk.sea.stats <- summarize(jfk.sea.airtime, max = max(air_time, na.rm = TRUE)/60, min = min(air_time, na.rm = TRUE)/60, ave = mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE)/60)
